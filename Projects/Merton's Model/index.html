            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to develop a credit risk model using the Merton model to estimate the default probability of a firm. 
                The Merton model is a structural model that evaluates a company's credit risk by treating its equity as a call option on its assets. 
                This approach allows us to estimate the probability that the value of the firm's assets will fall below its liabilities, which indicates a potential default.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Steps for the Model</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Data Collection:</strong> Use financial APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance or WRDS) to obtain the historical balance sheet data, including key variables like total assets, 
                equity, and debt. Collect market information such as the latest stock price, shares outstanding, and risk-free rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Model Inputs Calculation:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Market Value of Equity (E):</strong> Calculate using the latest stock price and number of shares outstanding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equity Volatility (σ_E):</strong> Compute from the historical daily returns of the stock price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Debt Value (K):</strong> Obtain from balance sheet data, representing the sum of long-term debt and current liabilities.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Asset Value (A) and Asset Volatility (σ_A) Estimation:</strong> Use an iterative process to estimate the firm's total asset value and asset volatility using the equity value, equity volatility, and debt value.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Probability of Default (PD) Calculation:</strong> Use the Black-Scholes option pricing formula to estimate the probability that the firm's asset value will fall below its debt value at the time of debt maturity.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Sensitivity Analysis:</strong> Analyze how changes in key parameters (e.g., debt value, asset volatility, risk-free rate) impact the probability of default.
                Create visualizations to illustrate the relationship between these factors and the estimated PD.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Credit Rating Comparison:</strong> Compare the calculated probability of default with industry-standard credit ratings from agencies like Moody's or S&P to determine the equivalent credit rating for the firm.
            </p>

                    <figcaption>The graph you've provided shows the Probability of Default (PD) as a function of varying Debt Value (K).
                                We can observe that as the debt value increases, the Probability of Default also increases significantly, especially beyond a certain debt threshold. 
                               This is consistent with intuition—higher levels of debt make it more challenging for the firm to meet its obligations, increasing its likelihood of default.

                    <figcaption>This graph shows the Probability of Default (PD) as a function of Asset Volatility.
                     As asset volatility increases, the Probability of Default also increases. 
                     This trend makes sense because higher asset volatility implies greater uncertainty in the asset's value, 
                     which in turn raises the risk of the asset value dropping below the debt value, leading to default.

                    <figcaption>The graph above shows the Probability of Default (PD) as a function of the Risk-Free Rate (r).
                         As the risk-free rate increases, the Probability of Default decreases. 
                         This is because a higher risk-free rate implies that the present value of the debt (discounted at the risk-free rate) is lower, 
                         reducing the likelihood that the firm will default on its obligations.

            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                Through this project, I successfully implemented the Merton model to estimate the credit risk of Ford Motor Company. By treating equity as a call option on the firm's assets, I was able to derive meaningful insights into the probability of default based on various financial parameters.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sensitivity analyses highlighted the critical factors influencing credit risk, such as debt levels, asset volatility, and prevailing risk-free rates. These analyses not only validated the robustness of the model but also provided valuable perspectives for financial decision-making and risk management.
            </p>
            <p>
                Comparing the calculated probability of default with industry-standard credit ratings affirmed the model's practical applicability, offering a quantifiable measure that aligns with established financial assessment frameworks.
